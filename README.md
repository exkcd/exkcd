### Heyo ðŸ‘‹

My name's Rey, and welcome to my Github profile :)

I am currently a student in uni trying to figure out their life in the world of computer science.

My hobbies outside of coding are generally having an existential crisis that's accompanied by a cup of coffee.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on just figruing out the ropes of the development world (and the cybersecurity world)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and C++ (which are the two I am currently studying in uni)
- âš¡Prounouns: they/them

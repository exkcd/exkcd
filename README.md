### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name's Rey, and welcome to my Github profile :)

I am currently a student in college trying to figure out their life in the world of computer science. My GitHub profile is mainly a showcase of the work done in college for now.

My hobbies outside of coding include having an existential crisis that's accompanied by a cup of coffee or tea.

- ðŸ”­ I'm just figuring out the ropes of the world of coding and development.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Java and C++ (which are the two I am currently studying in college).
- ðŸ˜„ Prounouns: they/them

**Yes, my username was inspired by Randall Munroe's webcomic "xkcd".**

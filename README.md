### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name's Rey, and welcome to my Github profile :)

I am currently a student in college trying to figure out the world of computer science. My GitHub profile is mainly a showcase of the work done in college, and some other side projects I am pursuing on my own.

My hobbies outside of coding include having an existential crisis that's accompanied by a cup of coffee or tea.

- ðŸ”­ I'm just figuring out the ropes of the world of coding and development. I'm aiming to achieve skills for future full-stack development.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Java and C++ in college and Python, Ruby and HTML & CSS on my own.
- ðŸ˜„ Prounouns: they/them

**Yes, my username was inspired by Randall Munroe's webcomic "xkcd".**

### Heyo 👋

My name's Rey, and welcome to my Github profile :)

I am currently a student in uni trying to figure out their life in the world of computer science.

My hobbies outside of coding include having an existential crisis that's accompanied by a cup of coffee.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on just figruing out the ropes of the development world (and the cybersecurity world)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java and C++ (which are the two I am currently studying in uni)
- 😄 Prounouns: they/them

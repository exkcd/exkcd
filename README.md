### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Rey, and welcome to my Github profile :)

I am currently a student in college trying to figure out the world of computer science. My GitHub profile is mainly a showcase of the work done in college, and some other side projects I am pursuing on my own (although I do not update this regularly).

My hobbies outside of coding include having existential crises accompanied by an iced coffee with whey protein.

- ðŸ”­ I'm just figuring out the ropes of the world of coding and development for future full-stack development.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning what it means to sit behind a computer all day.
- ðŸ˜„ Prounouns: they/them
